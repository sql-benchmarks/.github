# Open Source SQL Benchmarks

Open source SQL benchmarks SQLBench-H and SQLBench-DS, derived from TPC-H and TPC-DS under the TPC's Fair Use Policy.

These benchmarks simply measure the execution time of the individual queries, which is very different from running an official TPC benchmark, which would require performing transactional updates and measuring throughput of concurrent queries.
